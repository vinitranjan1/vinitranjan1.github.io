I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Bartolomeo Stellato's group](https://stellato.io/) at Princeton's [Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE)](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) department, where I completed my PhD.

My research focuses on *real-time optimization*. Specfically, I work on theoretical and data-driven methods to verify performance for parametric problems.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Math and Computer Science from Duke University (December 2019).

My email is vranjan AT princeton DOT edu.

I  am on the market for industry research jobs in 2026. Please feel free to send me an email and I would be happy to discuss any opportunities.
