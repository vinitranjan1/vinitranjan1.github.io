I am a third year PhD candidate in [Bartolomeo Stellato's group](https://stellato.io/) at Princeton's [Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE)](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) department.

My research focuses on *real-time optimization*. Specfically, I work on theoretical and data-driven methods to certify performance for parametric problems.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Math and Computer Science from Duke University (December 2019).
